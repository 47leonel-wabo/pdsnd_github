# Description

This project aims to use collaborative tool like Git and GitHub applied on the previous project named (_Eplore US Bikeshare Data_) in which we explore three ___.csv___ files (Chicago, Washington, and New York) representing records of a bikeshare system with a Python and associate tools (_Pandas_, _Numpy_, ...), in order to extract insight information like _trip duration_, _most common hour of a day_, _most common start station_, and many other statistics. During that previous project the main purpose was to allow user to eplore those data through an interactive way - selected filter as well as dataset to apply to. Therefore, this current project exposes the previous one through Version Control System toolkit "_Git_".
